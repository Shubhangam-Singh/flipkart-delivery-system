# 📦 Flipkart Hyperlocal Delivery Assignment System

A lightweight RESTful backend service that automates the assignment of Flipkart Quick orders to the most optimal delivery partner — in real-time, using a smart priority scoring system.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Flipkart Quick promises grocery and essentials delivery within **90 minutes**. As demand increases, manually assigning orders to delivery partners creates delays and inefficiencies.

This project solves that by offering a **smart assignment engine** using Flask, where:

- Orders are instantly assigned to the **best available partner**
- Assignments are made based on **rating, availability, pincode, and capacity**
- You can test all endpoints easily with a built-in Python test script

---

## 🧠 Assignment Logic (Core Rules)

When a new order is placed, the system applies the following logic:

### ✅ Filtering Criteria:

- Partner must be **AVAILABLE**
- Partner must be in the **same pincode** as the order
- Partner must have **capacity > 0**

### 📊 Priority Score Calculation:

Priority Score = (rating × 0.6) + (capacity × 0.4)

### ⚖️ Tie-Breaker:

If two partners have the same score, choose the one with the **alphabetically smaller `partnerId`**.

### 🔄 Assignment:

- Assign the order to the top-scoring eligible partner
- Update order status to **ASSIGNED**
- Reduce partner’s capacity by **1**
